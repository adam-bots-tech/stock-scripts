# Stock Scripts

Misc scripts for running risk/reward simulations, performing some basic math for trade planning and custom screening of stocks.

To use, clone the [Stock Library](https://github.com/adam-long-tech/stock-libraries) repo and follow the README instructions to install locally with pip.

Then run `pip install -e .` from within inside the stock-scripts directory.

Copy the example_configuration.py file and rename it to configuration.py. Alter the variables inside to configure the scripts.
